# Algebra Solver Chatbot

## Overview

This is a simple web application that functions as an Algebra Solver Chatbot.  You input an algebra problem, and the bot attempts to provide a solution and, if available, the steps to arrive at that solution.

## Features

* **Algebra Problem Solving:** Solves basic algebra problems.
* **Step-by-Step Solutions:** Provides step-by-step solutions for some problems.
* **MathJax Integration:** Uses MathJax to render mathematical notation correctly in the output.
* **Simple User Interface:** A straightforward input and output design.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * React
    * HTML
    * CSS
* **Backend:**
    * Node.js (Express.js) - (Based on the fetch URL `http://localhost:8000/api/solve`, the application interacts with a server)
* **Math Rendering:** MathJax

## Setup Instructions

Since this application requires a backend server (Node.js/Express.js), follow these steps to get it running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the server directory:**
    ```bash
    cd server  #  If there is a server directory
    ```
3.  **Install server dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    * The server should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

5.  **Navigate to the client directory:**
    ```bash
    cd client # If the React code is in a 'client' directory, otherwise, stay in the root.
    ```

6.  **Install client dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
7.  **Start the client:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    * This will usually open the application in your default web browser.  If not, it will provide an address (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) to access the application.

## How to Use

1.  **Enter a problem:** Type your algebra problem into the input box.  For example: `2x + 3 = 7`.
2.  **Click "Solve":** Press the "Solve" button.
3.  **View the results:**
    * The solution to the problem will be displayed.
    * If available, the steps taken to solve the problem will also be shown.
    * If there is an error, an error message will be displayed.

## Assumptions

* The backend server is running at `http://localhost:8000`.  If your server is running on a different port or address, you will need to change the `fetch` URL in the `App.jsx` file.
* The application expects the server to respond with a JSON object containing the solution and optionally an array of steps.

## Potential Improvements

* **More Robust Error Handling:** Improve error handling to catch more edge cases and provide more informative error messages to the user.
* **Wider Range of Problems:** Expand the application's ability to solve more complex algebra problems, including inequalities, systems of equations, and more advanced topics.
* **Improved Step Explanations:** Provide more detailed and user-friendly explanations of the steps involved in solving the problem.
* **User Interface Enhancements:** Improve the user interface with a more modern design, better feedback, and potentially a chat-like interface.
* **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests to ensure the application's reliability.
* **Backend Optimization:** Optimize the backend server for performance and scalability.
* **Persistence:** Implement a database to store problem history.
* **Accessibility:** Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
* **Mobile Responsiveness:** Make the application work well on different screen sizes.
